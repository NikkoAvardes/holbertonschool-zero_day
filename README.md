## 📋 Description

This repository contains the foundational exercises and projects for the Holberton School curriculum. "Zero Day" represents the beginning of the journey into software engineering, covering essential tools and practices that every developer needs to master.

## 🎯 Learning Objectives

- Understand the basics of Git and version control
- Master command-line navigation and usage
- Learn proper documentation practices
- Set up and configure development environments
- Follow professional coding workflows
- Collaborate using GitHub

## 🛠️ Technologies & Tools

- **Git** - Version control system
- **GitHub** - Code hosting and collaboration
- **Linux/Unix** - Command-line interface
- **Bash** - Shell scripting basics
- **Vim/Emacs** - Text editors

## 📁 Repository Structure

### `/git`
Introduction to Git version control:
